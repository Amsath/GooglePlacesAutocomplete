# Google Places Autocomplete - React Native App

This React Native application demonstrates how to use the **Google Places API (v1)** to implement a simple single-page app for place autocomplete and mapping, using **Redux**, **Redux-Observable**, and **Ant Design** components.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Google Places Autocomplete using the new `places.googleapis.com/v1/places:autocomplete` API
- Fetches full place details (lat/lng) on selection using `places.googleapis.com/v1/places/{place_id}`
- Displays selected location on a map with `react-native-maps`
- Autocomplete search results are managed via Redux and Redux-Observable
- Recent search history is stored in Redux and displayed below the map
- Uses mock data as a fallback if API fails
- Modern, scalable folder structure using best practices
- Ant Design components for clean and simple UI

---

## üì¶ Libraries Used

- `react-native-maps` - display the map and markers
- `redux`, `react-redux` - state management
- `redux-observable`, `rxjs` - handle async side effects
- `@ant-design/react-native` - UI components
- `axios` - API calls

---

## üõ† Fallback on API Failure

If the Google API fails (e.g., rate limit, network error, invalid key), the app automatically switches to **mock predictions** to continue providing basic UX without crashing.

This fallback is implemented in the service:

```js
if (response.data.status === 'REQUEST_DENIED') {
    console.warn('Google Places API request denied. Using mock data.');
    return { predictions: PREDICTIONS_DATA };
}
```

You can find `mockData` defined in the service file.

## üîê API Key Security

- The app uses API keys restricted by **Android package name** and **SHA-1 fingerprint**
- The key is injected in `AndroidManifest.xml` for `react-native-maps`:
  ```xml
  <meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY" />
  ```

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
npm install

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```
## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```
### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
